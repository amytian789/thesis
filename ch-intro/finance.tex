\section{Portfolio management}
\label{sec:intro:finance}

An important application of correlation graphs is in modeling the dependencies among financial equities. Determining the relationship among various stocks is especially useful when managing portfolios. One such methodology is the ``buy and hold'' tactic where an investor selects a portfolio of stocks and never rebalances. The idea is to select diversified stocks with low correlation and positive drift such that losses are offset by gains, and the portfolio gains on average. This strategy is especially useful when transaction costs are high as fees are prohibitive to rebalancing gains. 

In a world with low transaction costs, however, there is more to be gained (less to be lost, alternatively) by frequently rebalancing the portfolio rather than holding. The concept for stock picking is similar to that of ``buy and hold'', though there are some key difference. Another component for successful rebalancing gains is for the stock returns to be relatively independent~\cite{liuh2016}. Thus, when one stock goes down, the others do not fall with it; with perfect independence, rebalancing gains become a function of the volatility of the stocks rather than of stock returns. This is further important because frequent asset trading may move the market and lead to unexpected price swings. With independent stocks, the price risk associated with rebalancing is minimized. In summary, rebalancing gains are best suited to markets with low correlation, independent returns, and high volatility~\cite{liuh2016}.  

Another financial application is the creation of a predictive stock model. Predictive models are a form of ``model selection'' where dependence rather than independence is important. Model selection addresses the problem of determining which explanatory variables (commonly seen as columns of the matrix $X$) are informative to explain the variation in the response variable (commonly seen as the vector $Y$). This is also related to the concept of ``sparsity,'' a statistical term referring to the fact that many coefficients of a fitted model should be 0. Model selection with sparsity aids in the interpretability of the model since there are fewer variables for data analysts to understand. This is another way to view rebalancing; the predictive model, if it is to be believed, can signal price swings to come which open up arbitrage opportunities. Furthermore, stocks which are uncorrelated are those with insignificant coefficients in the resulting model; this ``negative space'' point of view is partly utilized in the stock selection methodology for correlation graphs proposed in  Section~\ref{sec:usage:stockselection}.

It must be noted that correlation alone cannot capture the full complexity of these financial applications. However, it is still an important component of portfolio management in theory and in practice. Regardless, correlation graphs and their financial applications are not solutions to the two problems proposed in Section~\ref{sec:intro:problem}. Rather, correlation graphs and their financial applications are a concrete application of whatever the proposed solution is (A detailed application may be found in Chapter~\ref{ch:usage}, and a stock selection methodology for correlation graphs is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:usage:stockselection}). What follows is a roadmap of the high-dimensional visualization solution that is developed further in this paper.
