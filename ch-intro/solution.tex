\section{Solution overview}
\label{sec:intro:solution}

In this work, we tackle the problem by developing a sophisticated visualization system (abbreviated VS) to explore the data and numerical model in a different way. Specifically, we focus on two aspects of the VS that addresses the two problems raised in Section~\ref{sec:intro:problem}: (1) the procedure of sorting through plots is efficiently automated by learning the user's interests, and (2) the procedure of comparing the numerical and visual output is also automated. This allows the system to find visually interesting relationships that the numerical model may have missed and/or toss out relationships which turn out to be uninteresting. Furthermore, this allows future analysts to combine visual feedback with the numerical feedback from estimators to make better decisions during data analysis and provide clear justification of their decisions.
