\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:intro:problemstatement}

Often in modern multivariate analyses, data analysts rely solely on statistical estimators to explore the data. However, since each estimator inherently performs well or poorly under different settings, data analysts are unable to differentiate between the properties intrinsic to the dataset and the spurious properties the estimators added. Furthermore, the rapid increase in computing resources has led to the proliferation of high-dimensional datasets, which are more tedious to properly visualize. The problem is to find a way to visualize data to improve decision making and verify numerical models. To solve this, we develop a system that allow future analysts to visually confirm models determined through numerical methods. This enables data analysts to gain intuition on patterns in the data and recognize problems with various estimators. Furthermore, this tool increases standardization, and subsequently accountability, within data analysis. Our primary application focus is on graphical models and their financial applications. However, the visualization framework discussed in this work can be applied to any data analysis.
