First, I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Han Liu, for his 
guidance and expertise.

friendly Munchlax. 

I would like to thank Tony for emergency kittens and delicious weekend noms.

Finally, last but not least, I would like to thank my parents for their 
encouragement, support, and unconditional love.
