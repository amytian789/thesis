\section{Data collection}

((I will explain how I collected the stock data (end-of-day historical prices for a thousand stocks over the last decade). I will also explain the data cleaning (to get rid of the dependency on time). This will be done by fitting a regression to the values and using the residuals as the new dataset. This makes it appear as if it is independent draws from a sample (perhaps this can be proved more rigorously).))
