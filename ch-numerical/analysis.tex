\section{Analysis with existing tools}
\label{sec:numerical:analysis}

((Analogous to before, I will perform a full analysis without ever plotting the data. The goal is to find independent stocks for portfolio rebalancing. I will use a pre-made graphical model in order to fit the data numerically (as this is not the focus of the thesis – this can be thought of as another step of “data processing” for the visualization system input). For simplicity (and since there are known, clear trends that we can expect of the conditional plots), I will probably use (and explain why I decided to use) the Gaussian graphical model.))
