\label{sec:visualizer:features}

\subsection{Numerical features}

((Our goal is to quantify various features of a scatter plot. One category of features are numerical features. These include Pearson correlation, tests of independence, mutual information criterion, etc))

\subsection{Visual features}

((The other category of feature are visual. How many points are near the center of the plot? How many points lie above the linear regression line? ))
