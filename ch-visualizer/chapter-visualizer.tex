\chapter{Visualization System \label{ch:visualizer}}

Regardless of whether high dimensional data visualization methods are
computationally heavy or interaction heavy, user interactivity is a critical
component of high dimensional visualization analysis; it is simply a
question of what degree~\cite{lius2016}. It is not enough to simply have user 
interaction, however. Given $d$ variables, there are a total of $d\choose 2$ 
possible scatter plots of the data. This blows up almost quadratically as $d$ 
increases, which is infeasible for the analyst to sort through in any 
reasonable amount of time. Subsequently, automation is another necessary 
element in the task of visualizing high dimensional datasets.

We develop a system that first learns what visual patterns the data analyst 
finds promising, querying the user where the decision boundary is ambiguous. It 
then automatically iterates through thousands
of possible plots and returns an adjacency matrix that captures the 
classifications of variable pairs. The VS may then return several plots for the 
user, perform line-up tests to refine the tree~\ref{sec:futurework:lineup}, or 
compare the visual graph with a numerical graph of the user's choice. This 
allows users to compare and contrast visual feedback with numerical
algorithms for improved model selection. Figure~\ref{fig:visualizer:vs} 
is a visual summarization of the system.

Section~\ref{sec:visualizer:scatterplot} describes characteristics of an 
interesting plot; mindfulness and incorporation of these ideas in the VS 
facilitates improves user accuracy in stage 1 . 
Sections~\ref{sec:visualizer:al} and ~\ref{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration} 
provide a brief overview of stage 1 and stage 2 respectively (see 
Figure~\ref{fig:visualizer:vs}) while 
Section~\ref{sec:visualizer:focus} describes the focus of the rest of the work 
which respond to the problems posed in Section~\ref{sec:intro:problem}.
