\section{Automated plot generation (Stage 2)}
\label{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration}

\subsection{User interaction with active learning output}
\label{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration:user}

((Now that the system has learned the user’s interest, the user should be able to understand his/her own interests. We provide visualization tools of the resulting classifier itself such as a heat map, which there are also multiple ways to visualize))

\subsection{Plot generation and feedback}
\label{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration:feedback}

((Equipped with the learned classifier of the user’s interest, the system can now automatically generate thousands of new plots and label them automatically. The most interesting plots are returned the user along with the explanatory variable (including possible interaction terms) corresponding to the plot))
