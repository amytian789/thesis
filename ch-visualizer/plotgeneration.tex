\section{Automated plot generation (Stage 2)}
\label{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration}

Utilize the CLASSIFIER to fit the rest of the $d$ choose 2 scatterplots

\subsection{User interaction with active learning output}
\label{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration:user}

((Now that the system has learned the user’s interest, the user should be able
to understand his/her own interests. We provide visualization tools of the
resulting classifier itself such as a heat map, which there are also multiple
ways to visualize))

\subsection{Plot generation and feedback}
\label{sec:visualizer:plotgeneration:feedback}

((Equipped with the learned classifier of the user’s interest, the system can
now automatically generate thousands of new plots and label them automatically.
The most interesting plots are returned the user along with the explanatory
variable (including possible interaction terms) corresponding to the plot))

3 options....list out the interesting vs not interesting plots, refine the
decision tree via lineup tests, or return graph comparison feedback between the
VISUAL and NUMERIC graph
See FUTURE EXTENSIONS for the 2nd option
