\chapter{Graph comparison \label{ch:gc}}

Graph comparison may be reduced to a problem of measuring the difference 
between two graphs. 
A primary goal of the visualization system is to allow the user to better 
verify their numerical results with visual intuition. As such, there are two 
main goals for graph comparison output: (1) allow the user to gain some 
intuition about the qualities of the visual graph in order to better understand 
their perceptions of a ``visual trend'' in the data, and (2) provide a metric 
that quantifies the difference between the visual graph and numeric graph 
(supplied by the user). With the knowledge of both in hand, the user may 
reevaluate their numeric methods and utilize the results in alternate 
applications (For example, the second metric is utilized to select stocks for a 
portfolio in Chapter~\ref{ch:usage}). It should be noted that we operate under 
the assumption that the graphs are labeled. This avoids the sticky issue of 
isomorphism and more naturally lends itself to the visualization system's 
goals. As the VS is concerned with practical application in data 
analytics, each variable in a dataset should already correspond to some label 
(e.g. various stocks).
What follows is broad overview of two graph comparison methods in 
Section~\ref{sec:gc:litreview} with more details on the graph summarization 
comparison method in Section~\ref{sec:gc:methods}. Finally, we propose a method 
to select the graph $\hat{G^i}, i \in \{1,...,k\}$ out of $k$ given graphs 
where $\hat{G^i}$ is most similar to the ``base'' graph $\hat{G}$ and perform 
a simulation study to demonstrate the method's viability in 
Section~\ref{sec:gc:examples}.
