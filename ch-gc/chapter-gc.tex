\chapter{Graph comparison \label{ch:gc}}

Graph comparison may be reduced to a problem of measuring the difference 
between two graphs. 
A primary goal of the visualization system is to allow the user to better 
verify their numerical results with visual intuition. As such, the graph 
comparison measure is an important output of the VS that allows the user to 
quantify the difference between the methods, prompting the user to rethink 
their methods as needed. Furthermore, graph comparison may be directly used to 
compare visual and numeric correlation graphs, which we utilize to select 
stocks for a portfolio in Chapter~\ref{ch:usage}.
