Often in modern multivariate analyses, data analysts rely solely on statistical
estimators to explore the data. We are interested in visualizing 
high-dimensional correlation graphs as a way to verify numerical tests of 
dependence, which have far-reaching financial implications. High-dimensional 
visualization is problematic because (1) the number of plots to sort through 
increases quadratically as the number of variables increase, (2) it is tedious 
to verify numerical results with visual results and vice versa. We 
present a visualization tool that actively learns user preferences, applies 
the fitted classifier to unlabeled data, and outputs the difference among the 
numerical graph $G^{\text{num}}=(V,E)$ and the visual graph $G=(V,E)$. 
As a specific response to the aforementioned problems, we focus on the active 
learning and graph comparison components of the visualizer system. Both employ 
simulation studies in order to select the best procedure for use in the 
selection of healthcare stocks for a portfolio. The data is run through the 
visualization system, which utilizes the $----$ active learning 
algorithm and $----$ graph comparison method to select the correlation graph 
$G^{\text{num}}$ closest to the system's output $G$. The portfolios 
are then put through a ``buy and hold'' strategy. Yearly returns are compiled, 
and the portfolio corresponding the selected correlation graph $G^{\text{num}}$ 
is one of the top performers (??). The visualization tool provides a simple and 
intuitive way to improve predictive and portfolio management methods in the 
financial industry. Moreover (and arguably more importantly), it increases 
standardization in the data analysis process, thereby increasing accountability 
in an industry where ambiguity can mean a global financial crisis.
