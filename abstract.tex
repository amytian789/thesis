Often in modern multivariate analysis, data analysts rely solely on statistical
estimators to explore the data. We are interested in using the notion of visual 
dependence to verify numerical tests of dependence (specifically, we 
focus on correlation metrics) and applying the results in portfolio selection, 
a setting that involves high-dimensional data sets. High-dimensional 
visualization is problematic because the number of pairwise plots to sort 
through increases quadratically as the number of variables increase.
We present a visualization system that actively learns the user's concept of
visual correlation in the data, applies the fitted classifier to unlabeled data 
to form the visual graph $\hat{G}=(V,E)$, and outputs the difference between 
$\hat{G}$ and some given numerical graph 
$\hat{G}^{\text{num}}=(V,E^{\text{num}})$.
%As a specific response to the aforementioned problems, 
Specifically, we focus on the active learning and graph comparison components 
of the visualization system. We perform a simulation study with parameters that 
mimic the intended qualities of the system in order to select the best active 
learning method to use in the visualization system for the financial 
application. We compile various graph summarization metrics to compute the 
difference between two graphs (e.g. $\hat{G}$ and $\hat{G}^{\text{num}}$), and 
propose and verify a procedure for selecting $\hat{G}^*$, the numerical 
correlation graph most 
similar to some base graph (the visual graph $\hat{G}$ in this case), given the 
differences. Furthermore, we propose a simple but effective stock selection 
procedure that, given a correlation graph,  selects a ``buy and hold'' 
portfolio of $k$ stocks which are as uncorrelated with each other as possible, 
a proxy for independence. 
Numerical correlation graphs $\hat{G}^{i, \text{num}}$ are formed from stock 
price 
data with correlation metric $i \in I$ (the set of all correlation metrics), 
the data is fed into the visualization 
system to create $\hat{G}$, stocks are selected for portfolios, and yearly 
returns 
are compiled. The results indicate that the portfolio corresponding to 
$\hat{G}^*$, 
the numerical correlation graph which most resembles the visual correlation 
graph $\hat{G}$, is the top performer.
