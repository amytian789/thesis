\section{Healthcare stock data}
\label{sec:usage:data}

We select 43 stocks from the healthcare industry to apply the system to. There 
are 4113 observations of the stocks from 1998 to 2014. We have cleaned the data 
to get rid of the dependency on time so that each observation of a stock may 
better simulate an independent draw from some distribution. This is done by 
fitting a regression to the values and using the residuals as the new dataset.


For $i\in\{1,...,4\}$, 
we employ a ``buy and hold'' tactic to compare the performance of each 
portfolio $P_i$ selected utilizing the methodology described in 
Section~\ref{sec:usage:stockselection}), which correspond to correlation graphs 
$G_i^{\text{num}}=(V,E)$. While a rebalancing method performs better in 
practice~\cite{liuh2016}, the ``buy and hold'' is better-suited for observing 
the portfolio performances over time, providing a more concrete basis of 
comparison for the selected correlation coefficient.
