\section{Data}
\label{sec:usage:data}

The data set contains 4110 price observations of 43 stocks from the healthcare 
industry from 1998 to 2014. The data is cleaned to get rid of the 
dependency on time and yearly seasonality so that each observation may better 
simulate an independent draw from some distribution. This is done 
with the \texttt{sstl} function from the \texttt{Rsafd} package in R; 
after fitting the seasonal and trend components, the residuals are used as the 
new dataset. A list of tickers and their associated firms may be found in 
Table~\ref{tab:usage:tickers}.

The data has been split into testing and training sets of equal length (2050 
observations each) between 1998 and 2014. The idea is that we are standing 
in the middle (at 3/13/2006 to be precise) and wish to select a healthcare 
portfolio on that day. Although the future is uncertain, we do have the 
historical price performance of each stock and may also extract qualities such 
as drift, volatility, returns, etc. from the data. As such, correlation graphs 
(see Section~\ref{sec:intro:correlation}) may be computed from the data and 
used to inform the portfolio selection. Once the portfolio has been 
selected and purchased, the ``buy and hold'' model is implemented (no 
rebalancing occurs), and we observe the yearly returns until 2014. The next 
section details the stock selection procedure given a correlation graph.
