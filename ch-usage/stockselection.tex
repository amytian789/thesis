Once we have the resulting graph, what do we do with it?

``Formally, two random variables X and Y with
cumulative distribution functions FXðxÞ and FYðyÞ,
and probability densities fXðxÞ and fYðyÞ, are independent
if and only if the combined random variable
ðX,YÞ has a joint cumulative distribution function
FX,Yðx, yÞ ¼ FXðxÞFYðyÞ, or, equivalently, a joint
density fX,Yðx, yÞ ¼ fXðxÞfYðyÞ. We say that two
random variables X and Y are dependent if they
are not independent. The problem then is how to
measure and detect dependence from the observation
of the two random variables.''\cite{santos2013}
