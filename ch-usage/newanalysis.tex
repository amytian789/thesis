\section{New analysis}
\label{sec:usage:newanalysis}

((During the new analysis, I will make sure edges correspond with interesting conditional dependent plots \& non-edges correspond to non-interesting conditional dependencies. I will also ask whether the fitted graph matches intuitively what we expect to see (For example, given a Gaussian GM, we expect to see linear relationships among nodes with edges)))
