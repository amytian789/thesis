\section{Results}
\label{sec:usage:results}

Here, we have a comparative time plots of the ``buy and hold'' performance 
(yearly returns) of the S\&P 500, stocks selected from the final numerical 
correlation graph $G_i^{\text{num}}(V,E)$, and other correlation graphs 
$G_j^{\text{num}}(V,E)$ where $j\neq i$. We hope to find that correlation graph 
$i$, which was selected from the usage of the VS, is a top performer.

We may also analyze the VS graph output $G(V,E)$ against the final selection 
$G_i^{\text{num}}(V,E)$ by asking the following questions: What new links were 
formed? Which links were deleted? Did we actually find the
plots of those links interesting/not interesting? If it is possible (if the 
graphs are not too dense), then I would also include a visualization of 
$G(V,E)$ and $G_i^{\text{num}}(V,E)$.
