\section{Further extensions}

\subsection{Estimator selection}

((Estimator selection involves actively fitting the best model as opposed to ``checking'' a numerical model that’s been given. This problem is more difficult to define, and the value that the visualization system adds is not as concrete ))

\subsection{Outlier removal}

((Outliers are unavoidable in raw data and can skew results quite a bit. When can the system remove outliers? What criteria should it use? ))

\subsection{Edge-weighted graphs}

(( This is more of an extension on graphical models, but it is still related to estimator selection. In an edge-weighted graph, edges can be weighted depending on the type of conditional dependence – negative or positive, assign 1 or -1. 0 (no edge) still implies conditional independence ))
